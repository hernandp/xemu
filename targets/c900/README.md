My wild and lame try to emulate Commodore 900, with my own Z8001 emulation core.
Do not expect that it even compiles at the momement ... And if so anyway, it
won't work, it merely an incomplete, badly implemented Z8001 disassembler right now
with only some opcodes handled :-O Surely it will improve (hopefully ...) to the
point when it worth to try to run the code actually what Commodore 900 uses as
the boot ROM at least. Z8010 MMU emulation also needs to be written, btw.
